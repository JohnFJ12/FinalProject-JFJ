# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Cortex

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord chatbot that helps you solve Calculus 3 related problems such as Triple Integrals, Double Integrals, Partial Derivatives, gradient vectors, and more. It will also illustrate all the steps in the problem along with explanation for each part done.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?





## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will be able to get Triple Integrals, Double Integrals, Partial Derivatives and Gradient Vectors solved with my chatbot and it will show all the steps that where taken to find the solution. I will also show the integral symbol and the derivative and partial derivative using ASCII art.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will be able to get Triple Integrals, Double Integrals, Partial Derivatives and Gradient Vectors solved with my chatbot and it will show all the steps that where taken to find the solution ALONG WITH explanations behind each step. I will also show the integral symbol and the derivative and partial derivative using as much as realistic graphics to show the integral symbols and the partial derivatives.

I will be able to get Triple Integrals, Double Integrals, Partial Derivatives and Gradient Vectors solved with my chatbot and it will show all the steps that where taken to find the solution ALONG WITH explanations behind each step. Cortex will also be able to take in word problems with restrictions also translate between normal to spherical or cylindrical. I will also show the integral symbol and the derivative and partial derivative using as much as realistic graphics to show the integral symbols and the partial derivatives.



## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
