Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

SO FAR I HAVE DEPLY RESEARCHED THE MODULE I WILL BE USING TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THE INTERFACE OF THE CHATBOT AND CREATE A PLACE WHERE THE USER CAN RESPOND AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE/CODE SUCH INTERFACE ALREADY. I HAVE ALSO PLANNED OUT MOST OF FUNCTIONS THAT WILL BE COMPUTING THE DOT PRODUCT AND CROSS PRODUCT AND SHOW ALL THE WORK AT THE SAME TIME. I HAVE ALSO MOVED AWAY FROM MY INITIAL PLAN TO UTILIZE A DISCORD BOT AAS I DEEMED IT WOULD LIMIT HOW GREAT MY PROGRAM CAN BE AND INSTEAD I WILL BE USING THE TKINTER MODULE TO HELP ME CREATE MY OWN BOT.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I HAVE NOT CODED ANY OF MY FUNCTIONS AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO EVEN PLAN OUT MY INTEGRAL FUNCTION

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I HAVE DEEPLY HAD ISSUES DURING MY PLANNING OF MY INTEGRAL FUNCTION AS FINDING HOW TO DO U-SUBSTITUTION AND INTEGRATING BY PARTS IS NO EASY TASK.
